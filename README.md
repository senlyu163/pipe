This repository implement a intermedia to transfer data between excel and powerpoint.
Acccording to the demands, only support data from excel to powerpoint. If necessary, maybe support reverse later.

For rapid development, we decided to use python for this project development. Because there are some really nice python libraries such as [python-pptx](https://github.com/scanny/python-pptx), [openpyxl](https://github.com/ericgazoni/openpyxl) and so on.
